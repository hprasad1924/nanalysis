#number before ':' is atomic number of element
#isotops in line are sort (desc.) by their probability
#each prob is sum of previous prob
#so it looks like:
#N1 prob1 N2 prob2 N3 prob3 ...
#e.
#for some element with Z = X we have following isotops:
#no. of neutrons 6 with prob 80%, 7 with 5%, and 8 - 15%
#sorting:
#X: 6 0.8 8 0.15 7 0.05
#sum
#X: 6 0.8 8 0.95 7 1
